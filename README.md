## ✨ Introduction

MCITlib is a unified library for **continual instruction tuning** of **multimodal large language models (MLLMs)**. It integrates diverse continual learning methods into a single codebase, supporting both **image–text** and (as of v3) **video–text** setups. In addition to training scripts, MCITlib provides **standardized evaluation** across multiple benchmarks and architectures, making it easy to compare methods and reproduce results.

### Why MCITlib?

- 🚀 **Unified codebase & benchmarks:** To our knowledge, MCITlib is among the first open-source efforts to integrate both a method library and a benchmark suite for multimodal continual instruction tuning in one place.
- 🌟 **Easy to get started:** This README provides step-by-step guidance on environment setup, data preparation, training, and evaluation — designed to be accessible to newcomers.
- 🔄 **Actively maintained:** We regularly incorporate new methods, benchmarks, and base model support. See News for the latest updates (e.g., video support and the CL-VISTA benchmark in v3).

Whether you are exploring continual learning for MLLMs for the first time or benchmarking new approaches, MCITlib aims to be a practical starting point. Issues, suggestions, and contributions are welcome!

You need to modify the data path in all the scripts to your own path. Additionally, method-specific data such as replay data and router training data can be downloaded from [here](https://huggingface.co/MLLM-CL).

**Note (CL-VISTA `Space`):** The **Space** split is derived from **ScanNet** and is **not** shipped as ready-to-use videos with the Hugging Face metadata. Complete the **official ScanNet access steps** (agreement and instructions in the [ScanNet](https://github.com/ScanNet/ScanNet) repository). After your access is approved, configure credentials as documented there, then **from the root of your cloned ScanNet repository** run:

```bash
python download_scannetv2.py -o data --preprocessed_frames
```

Next, run this repository’s `/your_data_path/CL-VISTA/Space/convert_video.py` to merge each frame sequence into a video, and place the results under `your_data_path/CL-VISTA/Space/` so paths stay consistent with the CL-VISTA annotation JSON from Hugging Face.

## 🎨 Models

We currently provide a reproduction based on the [LLaVA-1.5-7B](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA), [InternVL-Chat-7B](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVL/tree/main/internvl_chat_llava), [Video-LLaVA-7B](https://huggingface.co/LanguageBind/Video-LLaVA-7B) and [VideoLLaMA2](https://huggingface.co/DAMO-NLP-SG/VideoLLaMA2-7B). Please download it to your local directory.
```

huggingface-cli download openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336 --local-dir /your_model_path/clip-vit-large-patch14-336

huggingface-cli download DAMO-NLP-SG/VideoLLaMA2-7B --local-dir /your_model_path/VideoLLaMA2-7B
```
For the CL-VISTA benchmark, we use a locally deployed Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 as the judge model to evaluate the correctness of model predictions. The model can be downloaded from:
```
huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 --local-dir /your_model_path/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507
```

Note: To meet the requirements of certain methods, we need to apply additional processing to the config file in the downloaded model. The details are outlined below:
1. add `"mm_text_select_layer": -1` and `"mm_text_tower": "/your_model_path/clip-vit-large-patch14-336"` to the `config.json` in your local model weight path.
2. remove `"temperature": 0.9` and `"top_p": 0.6` in the `generation_config.json` of your local model weight path.

We provide reference `config.json` and `generation_config.json` in `examples`.

## 🏃 How to run

Note: Our experiment is conducted in a CUDA 11.8 environment, with most libraries in the setup aligned to this CUDA version. Therefore, we recommend using `nvcc -V` to check the CUDA version on your current server. If it does not match, please install CUDA 11.8 before proceeding.
### 1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Ghy0501/MCITlib.git
cd MCITlib
```
### 2. Install Package for LLaVA and InternVL
```
conda create -n MCITlib python=3.10 -y
conda activate MCITlib
conda install pytorch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
cd LLaVA/LoRA-FT
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
pip install -e ".[train]"
```
### 3. Install packages for Video-LLaVA and VideoLLaMA2
**[VideoLLaVA]**: For official installation details, please refer to [Github](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Video-LLaVA).
```
cd Video-LLaVA/LoRA-FT
conda create -n videollava python=3.10 -y
conda activate videollava
pip install --upgrade pip  # enable PEP 660 support
pip install -e .
pip install -e ".[train]"
pip install decord opencv-python git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorchvideo.git@28fe037d212663c6a24f373b94cc5d478c8c1a1d
```
**[VideoLLaMA2]**: For official installation details, please refer to [Github](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/VideoLLaMA2).
```
cd VideoLLaMA2/LoRA-FT
pip install --upgrade pip  # enable PEP 660 support
pip install -e .
pip install flash-attn==2.5.8 --no-build-isolation
```

For installing [flash-attn](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases), we recommend downloading specified version from the official repository according to your CUDA and PyTorch versions, and placing it in a local directory for manual installation. For example:
```
pip install flash_attn-2.6.3+cu118torch2.0cxx11abiFALSE-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
```
For essential evaluation-related dependencies, please refer to the [UCIT](https://github.com/Ghy0501/HiDe-LLaVA) and [MLLM-CL](https://github.com/bjzhb666/MLLM-CL) repositories.

### 4. Path and parameter configuration

Before running any scripts, replace the placeholder paths below with the corresponding locations on your machine. Be sure to update dataset paths wherever they appear in the configs and scripts.

- Replace `/your_path/MCITlib_v3` with the absolute path to this repository on your system.
- Replace `/your_model_path/` with the directory that stores your pretrained or fine-tuned model weights.
- Replace `/your_data_path/` with the root directory of your datasets.
- Replace `/your_ckpts_path/` with the directory where training checkpoints and outputs should be written.

After updating these paths, adjust runtime parameters (for example, `gpu_num`) to match your hardware. All such settings are consolidated under the `configs/` directory.

**Tip:** In VS Code, use **Find in Folder** (workspace search) to locate and replace these placeholders efficiently.

### 5. Training and Evaluation

We provide predefined training and testing hyperparameters in the `configs` files within each method's directory, which can be adjusted as needed. The corresponding training and testing scripts are located in the `scripts` directory. Once all paths are correctly configured, the scripts should execute without issues. For example:
```
cd LLaVA/LoRA-FT
sh scripts/MCITlib/Train/train_DCL.sh
```
The program will automatically perform both training and inference. However, for ModalPrompt, training and inference must be executed separately. Please refer to its [repository](https://github.com/AuroraZengfh/ModalPrompt) for detailed instructions.

**Note:** KeepLoRA requires a sufficiently large GPU memory footprint to run. In the original environment reported by the authors, experiments were conducted on an H100 (80GB).
